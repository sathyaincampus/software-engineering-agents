    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *User Input*: A message from the user (text, audio, image, etc.)\n",
    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

      "User > Are there any new developments in drug discovery?\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Yes, there are **constant and significant new developments in AI-driven drug discovery**. This field is one of the most dynamic areas where AI is making a substantial impact. Here are some of the key recent trends and breakthroughs:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Accelerated Target Identification:**\n",
      "*   **Genomic and Proteomic Analysis:** AI algorithms are now incredibly good at sifting through massive datasets of genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic information. This allows researchers to identify novel disease targets (genes, proteins, pathways) that were previously difficult to uncover.\n",
      "*   **Network Biology:** AI helps map complex biological networks, revealing how different molecules interact and identifying key nodes that, when modulated, can impact disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Enhanced Molecule Design and Generation:**\n",
      "*   **Generative Models (e.g., GANs, VAEs):** These AI models can learn the chemical properties of known drugs and then generate entirely *new* molecular structures that are predicted to be effective against a specific target, while also optimizing for properties like solubility, safety, and ease of synthesis.\n",
      "*   **De Novo Design:** AI is moving beyond just optimizing existing molecules to designing them from scratch, tailored to precise requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Improved Prediction of Drug Efficacy and Safety:**\n",
      "*   **In Silico Screening:** AI can rapidly screen millions of potential drug compounds virtually, predicting how well they will bind to a target, their likely efficacy, and potential side effects, significantly reducing the need for expensive and time-consuming lab experiments.\n",
      "*   **ADMET Prediction:** AI models are becoming more accurate at predicting Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) properties of drug candidates early in the discovery process, preventing costly late-stage failures.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n",
      "*   AI can analyze vast amounts of data (clinical trial results, scientific literature, patient records) to identify existing drugs that might be effective for new indications, offering a faster and cheaper path to new treatments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Clinical Trial Optimization:**\n",
      "*   **Patient Stratification:** AI can identify patient subgroups most likely to respond to a particular drug, leading to more targeted and successful clinical trials.\n",
      "*   **Predicting Trial Outcomes:** AI models are being developed to predict the likelihood of success for clinical trials, helping pharma companies allocate resources more effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Specific Examples and Companies to Watch:**\n",
      "*   **Insilico Medicine:** Known for its \"end-to-end\" AI platform that has advanced multiple drug candidates from discovery to clinical trials. They recently made headlines for using AI to discover and design a novel drug for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) that is now in Phase II trials.\n",
      "*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Uses AI and automation to map cellular phenotypes and identify potential drug targets and therapies. They have a broad pipeline across various disease areas.\n",

      "*   **BenevolentAI:** Applies AI to analyze scientific literature and biological data to identify novel drug targets and develop new medicines.\n",
      "\n",
      "**7. The Rise of \"AI-First\" Biotech Companies:**\n",
      "*   A new wave of biotech companies are built entirely around AI, with their core strategy being AI-powered discovery. This is a significant shift from traditional pharma R&D.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What's driving these developments?**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Vast Datasets:** The explosion of biological data (genomic, proteomic, clinical, chemical) provides the raw material for AI training.\n",
      "*   **Advances in Machine Learning:** Sophisticated algorithms, particularly deep learning, are now capable of handling the complexity of biological systems.\n",
      "*   **Computational Power:** Increased access to powerful computing resources (GPUs, cloud computing) allows for the training of complex AI models.\n",
      "\n",
      "While AI has not yet delivered a \"blockbuster\" drug solely discovered and designed by AI that has reached market approval, the pace of progress is accelerating. Many AI-discovered or AI-designed drugs are now in various stages of clinical trials, suggesting that a significant impact is on the horizon.\n",
      "\n",
      " ### Session: compaction_demo\n",
      "\n",
      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to the second development I mentioned in the context of AI in drug discovery: **Enhanced Molecule Design and Generation using Generative Models.**\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a truly exciting area because it represents a shift from simply analyzing existing data to *creating novel solutions*. Here's a deeper dive:\n",
      "\n",
      "**What are Generative Models?**\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of drug discovery, generative models are a type of machine learning algorithm that can learn the underlying patterns and rules of chemical structures and their properties. Once trained, they can then be used to \"generate\" entirely new, previously unseen molecular structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of it like this:\n",
      "*   **Traditional Approach (Less Generative):** You might show a model many pictures of dogs and ask it to identify a dog in a new picture.\n",
      "*   **Generative Approach:** You show a model many pictures of dogs, and then ask it to *draw a new picture of a dog* that has never existed before, but still looks like a dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Types of Generative Models Used in Drug Discovery:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):**\n",
      "    *   **How they work:** GANs consist of two neural networks: a **Generator** and a **Discriminator**.\n",
      "        *   The **Generator** tries to create new data (in this case, molecular structures) that mimic the real data it was trained on.\n",
      "        *   The **Discriminator** tries to distinguish between real data (actual drug molecules) and fake data (molecules generated by the Generator).\n",
      "    *   **The \"Adversarial\" aspect:** These two networks compete against each other. The Generator gets better at creating realistic molecules by trying to fool the Discriminator, and the Discriminator gets better at spotting fakes by learning from the Generator's attempts. This iterative process leads to increasingly sophisticated generated molecules.\n",
      "    *   **Application:** Generating novel molecules with desired properties, or optimizing existing ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):**\n",
      "    *   **How they work:** VAEs are another type of neural network that learns to encode input data into a lower-dimensional \"latent space\" and then decode it back. The latent space is a compressed representation where similar molecules are located close to each other.\n",
      "    *   **Application:** By sampling points from this latent space and decoding them, VAEs can generate new molecular structures. They are also useful for exploring the chemical space and understanding relationships between different molecular properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Reinforcement Learning (RL) based methods:**\n",
      "    *   While not strictly \"generative\" in the same way as GANs or VAEs, RL can be used in conjunction with molecule generation. A \"policy\" (an AI agent) learns to construct a molecule step-by-step (e.g., adding atoms or bonds), receiving \"rewards\" based on whether the generated molecule meets certain criteria (e.g., high binding affinity, good ADMET properties).\n",
      "\n",
      "**How Generative Models are Revolutionizing Drug Discovery:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Exploring Untapped Chemical Space:** Traditional drug discovery often relies on screening libraries of known compounds or making small modifications to existing drugs. Generative models can propose entirely novel chemical scaffolds that human chemists might not have conceived of, opening up vast, unexplored regions of chemical space.\n",
      "*   **Designing for Specific Properties (Multi-Objective Optimization):** Beyond just binding to a target, drugs need to be safe, bioavailable, and easy to manufacture. Generative models can be trained to optimize for multiple properties simultaneously, generating molecules that are not only effective but also possess desirable drug-like characteristics. This is a huge advantage over traditional methods where these properties are often addressed in separate optimization steps.\n",
      "*   **Accelerated Lead Optimization:** Once a \"lead\" compound is identified, it often needs to be optimized to improve its potency, reduce toxicity, and enhance pharmacokinetic properties. Generative models can rapidly propose variations of the lead compound that are predicted to have improved characteristics.\n",
      "*   **Reducing the Need for Large Experimental Libraries:** Instead of synthesizing and testing thousands of compounds, researchers can use AI to design and prioritize a much smaller, more promising set of molecules for experimental validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Challenges and Limitations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Synthesizability:** While AI can design novel molecules, ensuring that these molecules can actually be synthesized in a lab is a critical hurdle. Researchers are developing ways to integrate synthetic feasibility into the generation process.\n",
      "*   **Data Requirements:** Generative models require large, high-quality datasets of existing molecules and their properties for effective training.\n",
      "*   **\"Black Box\" Nature:** Like many complex AI models, understanding *why* a specific molecule was generated can be challenging, leading to concerns about interpretability and trustworthiness.\n",
      "*   **Validation:** Ultimately, any AI-generated molecule must be experimentally validated, which still requires significant time and resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, generative models are powerful tools that are transforming drug discovery by enabling the creation of entirely new molecular entities with tailored properties, thereby significantly accelerating the search for life-saving medicines.**\n",

      "**3. AI Platform and Technology Providers:**\n",
      "Some companies provide the underlying AI technology and platforms that can be adapted for drug discovery, or offer specialized generative AI tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Google (DeepMind/Isomorphic Labs):** DeepMind's AlphaFold has revolutionized protein structure prediction, which is foundational for drug discovery. Their spin-off, Isomorphic Labs, is explicitly focused on applying AI to drug discovery.\n",
      "*   **Nvidia:** While not a drug discovery company itself, Nvidia's powerful GPUs and AI software platforms (like Clara Discovery) are critical enablers for training and running complex generative models in drug discovery.\n",
      "*   **Startups focusing on specific niches:** There are numerous smaller startups that might focus on generative models for specific types of molecules (e.g., peptides, antibodies) or for very specific biological problems.\n",
      "\n",
