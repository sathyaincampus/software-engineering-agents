    "\n",
    "**When to use Custom Tools?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in tools like Google Search are powerful, but **every business has unique requirements** that generic tools can't handle. Custom tools let you implement your specific business logic, connect to your systems, and solve domain-specific problems. ADK provides multiple custom tool types to handle these scenarios."

    "**1. Dictionary Returns**: Tools return `{\"status\": \"success\", \"data\": ...}` or `{\"status\": \"error\", \"error_message\": ...}`  \n",
    "**2. Clear Docstrings**: LLMs use docstrings to understand when and how to use tools  \n",
    "**3. Type Hints**: Enable ADK to generate proper schemas (`str`, `dict`, etc.)  \n",
    "**4. Error Handling**: Structured error responses help LLMs handle failures gracefully  \n",
