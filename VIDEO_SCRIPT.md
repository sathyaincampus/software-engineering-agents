# SparkToShip - Hackathon Video Script
**Duration**: ~3 minutes  
**Format**: AI Voice Narration with Screen Recording/Slides  
**Target**: Kaggle Agents Intensive Capstone Project Judges

---

## 🎬 SCENE 1: THE HOOK (0:00 - 0:20)
**Visual**: SparkToShip logo animation → Problem statement graphics

**Narration**:
> "Imagine turning a simple idea into a fully functional, production-ready web application in just 10 minutes. Not a prototype. Not a mockup. A complete system with architecture, code, tests, and documentation. This is SparkToShip."

---

## 🎬 SCENE 2: THE PROBLEM (0:20 - 0:50)
**Visual**: Split screen showing frustrated developer switching between tools

**Narration**:
> "Building enterprise software is broken. Traditional AI coding tools suffer from context amnesia—they forget how a backend change breaks the frontend. Developers become project managers, manually copying context between chat windows and IDEs. The result? Spaghetti code that works in isolation but fails as a system. And documentation? Always outdated, making onboarding painfully slow and expensive."

---

## 🎬 SCENE 3: WHY AGENTS? (0:50 - 1:15)
**Visual**: Animated diagram showing 12 agents working together

**Narration**:
> "This is where agents shine. SparkToShip isn't a single AI assistant—it's an autonomous engineering organization. Twelve specialized agents, each an expert in their domain, working together like a real software team. The Product Manager creates requirements. The Architect designs the system. Developers write code. QA reviews it. And a Debugger agent fixes errors autonomously in a self-healing loop. Every agent has complete context, ensuring nothing is lost in translation."

---

## 🎬 SCENE 4: ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW (1:15 - 1:50)
**Visual**: Backend and Frontend architecture diagrams (the ones we generated)

**Narration**:
> "Built on Google's Agent Development Kit and powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash and Pro, SparkToShip uses a Hub-and-Spoke architecture. A central Orchestrator manages twelve agents organized into three teams: Strategy, Architecture, and Engineering. The Strategy team generates ideas and requirements. The Architecture team designs the system with live Mermaid diagrams. The Engineering team builds, tests, debugs, and documents everything. All of this runs on a FastAPI backend with a React frontend, featuring real-time system logs and visual artifact generation."

---

## 🎬 SCENE 5: LIVE DEMO (1:50 - 2:30)
**Visual**: Screen recording of actual workflow

**Narration**:
> "Let me show you. I enter 'task management app for remote teams.' In 30 seconds, the Idea Generator creates five complete product concepts. I select one. In one minute, the Product Manager generates a formal PRD with 15 user stories. The Software Architect designs the system architecture with sequence diagrams and database schemas. The Engineering Manager breaks it into 35 atomic tasks. Then, Backend and Frontend developers generate production-ready FastAPI and React code—complete with type hints, error handling, and best practices. The QA agent reviews everything. The E2E Test agent creates comprehensive test plans. And finally, the Walkthrough agent generates living documentation in text, slides, and video format. Total time? Ten minutes. From idea to fully documented application."

---

## 🎬 SCENE 6: THE BUILD & ADK MASTERY (2:30 - 2:50)
**Visual**: Code snippets and ADK concept checklist

**Narration**:
> "SparkToShip demonstrates mastery of Google ADK. We implement sequential agents for workflow, parallel agents for development, and loop agents for debugging. Custom tools handle JSON parsing and project persistence. InMemorySessionService manages state across the entire lifecycle. Context engineering ensures every agent has complete project history. Real-time observability with structured logging. And our Model Factory lets users switch between Gemini Flash for speed and Pro for reasoning—bringing your own model for complete control."

---

## 🎬 SCENE 7: THE IMPACT (2:50 - 3:00)
**Visual**: Impact metrics and cost savings graphic

**Narration**:
> "The impact? Ninety-nine point four percent cost reduction. What cost forty thousand dollars and two weeks now costs two hundred fifty dollars and ten minutes. Developer onboarding time? Cut by ninety percent. SparkToShip isn't just a hackathon project—it's the future of autonomous software development. From Spark to Ship in minutes."

---

## 🎬 CLOSING FRAME (3:00)
**Visual**: SparkToShip logo + GitHub link + "Built with Google ADK"

**Text on Screen**:
- **SparkToShip**
- From Spark to Ship in Minutes
- Built with Google ADK & Gemini 2.5
