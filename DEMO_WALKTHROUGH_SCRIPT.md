## 🎯 DEMO ORDER FLEXIBILITY

You asked if you can demo in any order - **YES!** Here are alternative flows:

### **Option A: Linear Flow** (Recommended - matches script)
Idea → PRD → Architecture → Sprint → Code → QA → Tests → Docs

### **Option B: Impact-First Flow** (Show the wow factor first)
Code → Architecture → PRD → Idea → Tests → Docs → Sprint

### **Option C: Technical Flow** (For technical judges)
Architecture → Code → Tests → PRD → Sprint → Docs → Idea

### **Option D: Speed Run** (Show all features quickly)
Rapid clicks through all steps showing each artifact for 2-3 seconds

**My Recommendation**: Use **Option A (Linear Flow)** because it tells a coherent story and matches the script I provided.

## 🎙️ FINAL RECOMMENDATION

### **Best Approach for You**:

1. **Record screen silently** (no voice, just mouse movements)
2. **Use Canva AI voice** for all narration (consistent, professional)
3. **Follow the 40-second demo script** above
4. **Add text overlays** to reinforce each step
5. **Speed up loading times** in post-production

This gives you:
- ✅ Professional quality
